Features of the fork:


- Uses the Glicko rating system instead of the Elo rating system 
- Supports a draw button 
- New -d argument to find duplicates. Using -d will show the user two similar photos and asks the user to either keep both, or delete one of them. The deleted photos will be moved to a "duplicates" folder
